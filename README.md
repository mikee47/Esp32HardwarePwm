 * ¹ High speed channels are only available when SOC_LEDC_SUPPORT_HS_MODE is defined as 1
 * ² The ESP32C3 does only support six channels, so 6 and 7 are not available on that SoC
 * 
 * The nomenclature of timers in the high speed / low speed blocks is a bit misleading as the idf api 
 * speaks of "speed mode", which, to me, implies that this would be a mode configurable in a specific timer
 * while in reality, it does select a block of timers.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```cpp
#include <SmingCore.h>
#include <Esp32HardwarePwm.h>

// Define pins for PWM output
std::vector<uint8_t> pwm_pins = {2, 4, 5, 18};

void init() {
    Serial.begin(SERIAL_BAUD_RATE);

    // Create PWM instance with default settings (10-bit, 1 kHz)
    Esp32HardwarePwm pwm(pwm_pins);

    if (pwm.isInitialized()) {
        pwm.setDutyChan(0, 256);              // raw duty on channel 0 (25 % of 1023)
        pwm.setDutyChan(1, 512);              // 50 % on channel 1
        pwm.analogWrite(pwm_pins[2], 768);    // legacy pin-indexed write

        Serial.println("PWM initialized successfully");
    } else {
        Serial.println("PWM initialization failed");
    }
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```cpp
#include <SmingCore.h>
#include <Esp32HardwarePwm.h>

std::vector<uint8_t> led_pins = {12, 13, 14};

Esp32HardwarePwm pwm(led_pins, Esp32HardwarePwm::Config{
    .timer = {
        .resolution = LEDC_TIMER_12_BIT,  // 12-bit (0-4095)
        .frequency  = 20000,              // 20 kHz
    },
    .phaseShift = {
        .mode = Esp32HardwarePwm::PhaseShiftMode::AUTO,
    },
});

void init() {
    if (pwm.isInitialized()) {
        pwm.fadeToValueChan(0, pwm.getMaxDuty(), 2000);  // fade to 100% over 2 s
        pwm.fadeToPercentChan(1, 50.0f, 1500);           // fade to 50% over 1.5 s
    }
}
```

## API Reference

### Configuration

All configuration is passed through the nested `Esp32HardwarePwm::Config` aggregate:

```cpp
struct Esp32HardwarePwm::Config {
    ledc_channel_t channelStart = LEDC_CHANNEL_0;  // first LEDC channel to allocate
    TimerConfig        timer          = {};         // frequency, resolution, timer index
    PhaseShiftConfig   phaseShift     = {};         // OFF / AUTO / MANUAL
    SpreadSpectrumConfig spreadSpectrum = {};       // OFF / ON
};

struct TimerConfig {
    ledc_mode_t      speed_mode  = LEDC_LOW_SPEED_MODE;
    ledc_timer_bit_t resolution  = LEDC_TIMER_10_BIT;  // 1-20 bits
    ledc_timer_t     timer_num   = LEDC_TIMER_0;
    uint32_t         frequency   = 1000;               // Hz
    ledc_clk_cfg_t   clk_cfg     = LEDC_AUTO_CLK;
};

struct PhaseShiftConfig {
    PhaseShiftMode      mode            = PhaseShiftMode::OFF;
    std::vector<int>    manual_hpoints  = {};  // one per pin, MANUAL mode only
};

struct SpreadSpectrumConfig {
    SpreadSpectrumMode mode         = SpreadSpectrumMode::OFF;
    uint8_t            WidthPercent = 0;   // deviation as % of base frequency
    uint16_t           Subsampling  = 0;   // PWM cycles between updates
};
```

### Main Class: Esp32HardwarePwm

#### Constructors

At its most basic the constructor only needs a pin list; all other settings default to 10-bit / 1 kHz / `LEDC_TIMER_0` / low-speed mode.

```cpp
Esp32HardwarePwm(std::vector<uint8_t>& pins);
Esp32HardwarePwm(std::vector<uint8_t>& pins, const Config& config);
```

> **Multiple instances**: each instance must use a distinct set of LEDC channels.  Set `config.channelStart` on the second instance to the first free channel (e.g. `LEDC_CHANNEL_3` if the first instance uses three channels).  Instances that share the same `timer_num` also share the same frequency and resolution — changing one affects the other.

#### Duty Cycle Control

Channels are zero-indexed in the order the pins were supplied to the constructor.

##### Channel interface (preferred)
```cpp
bool     setDutyChan(uint8_t channel, uint32_t duty, bool update_immediately = true);
uint32_t getDutyChan(uint8_t channel);
bool     setPhaseShiftChan(uint8_t channel, uint32_t phase_shift, bool update_immediately = true);
```

##### Pin interface (legacy)
```cpp
bool     setDuty(uint8_t pin, uint32_t duty, bool update_immediately = true);
uint32_t getDuty(uint8_t pin);
bool     analogWrite(uint8_t pin, uint32_t duty);
```

#### Frequency and Period Control
These calls set the pwm frequency. Be aware that, if spread spectrum is enabled, this is the center frequency that the spectrum is spread around
```cpp
bool setFrequency(uint32_t frequency);
uint32_t getFrequency() const;
bool setPeriod(uint32_t period_us);
uint32_t getPeriod() const;
```

#### Information
This interface provides information about the current Esp32HardwarePwm instance
```cpp
uint32_t getMaxDuty() const;
uint8_t getResolution() const;
uint8_t getPinCount() const;
bool isInitialized() const;
```

#### Control Functions
```cpp
void update();
bool start(uint8_t pin);
bool stop(uint8_t pin, uint8_t idle_level = 0);
void startAll();
void stopAll(uint8_t idle_level = 0);
```

#### Hardware Fade

Fade support is installed automatically on first use.

```cpp
bool enableFade();    // install LEDC fade ISR (called automatically by fade methods)
void disableFade();

// Fade to an absolute duty value
bool fadeToValueChan(uint8_t channel, uint32_t target_duty, uint32_t fade_time_ms);
// Fade to a percentage (0.0 – 100.0)
bool fadeToPercentChan(uint8_t channel, float target_pct, uint32_t fade_time_ms);
// Returns true while a hardware fade is in progress
bool isFadingChan(uint8_t channel) const;
```

#### Fade Queue

Each channel has an independent fade queue that can chain multiple fades without
application polling.  The queue depth defaults to `FADE_QUEUE_DEPTH` (10) and can
be changed per-channel at runtime before the queue is filled.

##### Modes

| Mode | Behaviour | Auto-start |
|------|-----------|------------|
| `FIFO` (default) | Entries play once in order; `onQueueEmpty` fires when exhausted | Yes — playback starts on first `queueFadeChan()` call |
| `CYCLIC` | Entries loop endlessly back to entry 0; `onCyclicWrap` fires each loop | No — call `startQueue()` after seeding all entries |

##### Queue management

```cpp
void    setQueueMode(uint8_t channel, QueueMode mode);  // FIFO or CYCLIC
QueueMode getQueueMode(uint8_t channel) const;

// Override the auto-start default set by setQueueMode()
void setQueueAutoStart(uint8_t channel, bool autoStart);
bool getQueueAutoStart(uint8_t channel) const;

// Change queue depth (only while queue is empty; default FADE_QUEUE_DEPTH = 10)
bool     setQueueCapacity(uint8_t channel, uint16_t depth);
uint16_t getQueueCapacity(uint8_t channel) const;

uint16_t getQueueEntries(uint8_t channel) const;  // entries currently queued
void     resetQueue(uint8_t channel);            // clear queue, preserve capacity
```

##### Enqueueing and starting

```cpp
// Enqueue a fade (absolute duty or percentage)
bool queueFadeChan(uint8_t channel, uint32_t targetDuty, uint32_t fadeTimeMs);
bool queueFadePercentChan(uint8_t channel, float targetPct, uint32_t fadeTimeMs);

// Explicitly start a CYCLIC queue (or restart an idle FIFO queue)
bool startQueue(uint8_t channel);
```

##### Callbacks

```cpp
// Fires after every individual fade completes (any mode)
pwm.setOnFadeDoneCallback([](uint8_t ch) { ... });

// Fires when a FIFO queue drains to empty
pwm.setOnQueueEmptyCallback([](uint8_t ch) { ... });

// Fires each time a CYCLIC queue wraps back to entry 0
pwm.setOnCyclicWrapCallback([](uint8_t ch) { ... });
```

##### Example — CYCLIC queue

```cpp
pwm.setQueueMode(1, Esp32HardwarePwm::QueueMode::CYCLIC);
pwm.queueFadePercentChan(1, 100.0f, 1000);
pwm.queueFadePercentChan(1,   0.0f, 1000);
pwm.queueFadePercentChan(1,  50.0f, 1000);
pwm.startQueue(1);  // must be called after seeding; CYCLIC does not auto-start
```

See `samples/FadeQueue_HwPWM` for a complete demonstration of both modes.

## Timing Accuracy

Three independent sources of error affect fade timing.  Understanding them helps
choose the right timer configuration and set realistic expectations.

### 1. Duty-step quantisation (applies to every fade call)

`ledc_set_fade_time_and_start` translates a requested fade duration into integer
hardware parameters:

```
cycles_per_step = floor(fade_ms × timer_freq_Hz / duty_levels)
actual_ms       = duty_levels × cycles_per_step × (1 / timer_freq_Hz) × 1000
```

Because of the `floor`, the actual duration is always **shorter** than requested.
The total shortfall is determined by the remainder of the division:

```
error_ms = (fade_ms × timer_freq_Hz  mod  duty_levels) / timer_freq_Hz
```

The error depends on how evenly the fade duration divides into duty steps — it
is **not** a simple function of bit depth or frequency alone.  Higher frequency
generally reduces the error (more cycles to distribute), but the specific
fade duration matters.  The maximum possible shortfall is one timer period
(when the remainder equals `duty_levels − 1`).

### 1a. Low `cycle_num` regime — large timing error and diagnostic warning

The hardware parameter `cycle_num` is the number of full PWM timer cycles the
LEDC peripheral spends at each duty step:

```
cycle_num = floor(freq_Hz × fade_ms / (1000 × duty_range))
```

where `duty_range` is the absolute difference between start and target duty
values.  When `cycle_num` is small the integer truncation from `floor` is a
large fraction of the true value, so the actual fade duration is much shorter
than requested.  For example:

| cycle_num | Typical timing error |
|---|---|
| 1 | up to −50 % |
| 3 | up to −25 % |
| 10 | up to −9 % |
| ≥ 20 | < 5 % (library threshold) |

The library warns once per channel whenever `1 ≤ cycle_num < 20`:

```
queueFadeChan: ch0 cycle_num=3 (< 20) — fade may be 929 ms short (hw limit).
Fix: increase fadeTimeMs, lower resolution, or raise frequency to >= 20475 Hz
```

The warning includes the minimum frequency needed to reach `cycle_num == 20` for
that specific `(fade_ms, duty_range)` combination — raising the frequency is the
lowest-impact fix when the PWM period is not otherwise constrained.

**What causes this?**  `cycle_num` decreases when:
- The fade duration is short relative to the duty range (fast fades over a wide range).
- The PWM frequency is low (long timer periods give fewer cycles per millisecond).
- The duty resolution is high (more steps means more time needed per step).

**How to fix it** — choose any combination that brings `cycle_num ≥ 20`:
1. **Increase `fadeTimeMs`** — gives LEDC more total timer cycles to distribute.
2. **Lower the duty resolution** — fewer steps means more cycles per step.
3. **Raise the PWM frequency** to at least the value printed in the warning.

`cycle_num == 0` is a separate case where the requested duration is shorter than
one full timer cycle.  LEDC clamps to 1 cycle, so the fade runs *longer* than
requested.  No warning is issued for this case because the error direction is
reversed and the magnitude is bounded by one timer period.

### 2. Queue-reload latency (applies to every step when chaining short fades)

When the LEDC fade-done ISR fires, the library posts a FreeRTOS message to the
Sming main-task queue.  The main task dequeues the entry and calls
`ledc_set_fade_time_and_start` for the next step.  Three sub-sources contribute:

| Sub-source | Typical cost |
|---|---|
| ISR → Sming task-queue post | < 10 µs |
| FreeRTOS task wake-up + context switch | ~10–50 µs |
| LEDC timer-cycle sync (next fade starts on next timer edge) | 2–3 timer periods |

The dominant term is the **timer-cycle sync**.  LEDC cannot start a new fade
mid-cycle; the `ledc_set_fade_time_and_start` call itself takes some time, and
by the time the hardware receives the start command the current timer cycle may
already be more than one period ahead.  In practice, 2–3 timer periods elapse
between the ISR firing and the next fade actually beginning.

### 3. Code-execution overhead

The path through the ISR, the FreeRTOS message, and `ledc_set_fade_time_and_start`
itself takes a few tens of microseconds.  This is negligible compared to the
timer-sync penalty for all practical frequencies (≤ 40 kHz) and cannot be
eliminated without a custom IDF patch that chains fades from within the ISR.

### Measured results

The following table was produced by `samples/TimingTest_HwPWM` running a 60 s
fade on an ESP32 (3000 × 20 ms micro-fades for the reload overhead measurement):

| Config       | Quant. error (single 60 s fade) |          | Reload overhead (3000 × 20 ms steps) |              |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|              | deviation        | % of 60 s | total excess   | per step     |
| 1 kHz/10-bit | −665 ms          | −1.11 %   | +8988 ms       | 2996 µs      |
| 4 kHz/10-bit | −154 ms          | −0.26 %   | +5989 ms       | 1996 µs      |
| 4 kHz/13-bit | −613 ms          | −1.02 %   | +2241 ms       |  747 µs      |
| 8 kHz/13-bit | −519 ms          | −0.87 %   | +1214 ms       |  404 µs      |

Key observations:
- **Quantisation error is fade-duration-dependent.**  The 4 kHz/10-bit config
  has the smallest absolute error for a 60 s fade, while 4 kHz/13-bit is worse
  than 4 kHz/10-bit — this is a coincidence of how 60 000 ms × 4000 Hz divides
  into 1023 vs 8191 duty steps.  For a different fade duration the ranking
  can change.
- **Reload overhead scales with timer period, but also with duty resolution.**
  At the same 4 kHz frequency, 13-bit resolution (8191 steps) gives ~750 µs/step
  while 10-bit (1023 steps) gives ~2000 µs/step.  With more duty steps LEDC
  spends fewer timer cycles per step, so the synchronisation wait is a smaller
  fraction of the step duration.  The combined effect means **higher frequency
  and higher bit depth both reduce per-step latency**.
- **Higher frequency always reduces per-step latency**, regardless of bit depth.

### Choosing timer parameters

| Goal | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Minimal per-step latency for chained micro-fades | Maximise frequency (8 kHz / 13-bit: ~400 µs/step) |
| Minimal quantisation error for a specific fade duration | Run `TimingTest_HwPWM` to find the config where `fade_ms × freq mod duty_levels` is smallest |
| Balance for RGBWW lighting (steps ≥ 20 ms) | 4 kHz / 13-bit: ~750 µs/step, <1.1 % length error |

See `samples/TimingTest_HwPWM` for a hardware benchmark that measures both
effects across multiple configurations in a single run.
